# Speech Training Pipeline

We've built this pipeline to simplify the process of preparing and training a speech to text (STT) models for the [Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/overview), which is part of [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

The goal is to simplify data preparation and lower the barrier of entry overall. With this pipeline developers have to provide only full audio files and full transcripts, along with Speech Service keys, and wait for custom speech model to be created. Additional improvements in quality can be achieved by running multiple iterations.

This pipeline references two other repos:

* [Custom Speech Processing Pipeline](https://github.com/shanepeckham/CustomSpeech-Processing-Pipeline)
* [Azure Speech CLI](https://github.com/msimecek/Azure-Speech-CLI)

To learn how work with the trained endpoint, look at [Speech Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/) in Microsoft documentation. There are SDKs and samples for UWP, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript etc.
